        <p>Online Curated is an online shop specialising in curated womenswear, designed and developed by me [ Holly Partridge ]. This was final project while studying on the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly. The brief was to create a full-stack application in one week. I created this full-stack application using Python, Django, PostgreSQL, React, and SCSS. I hope you enjoy it :&#41; .ï½¡.:*â˜†</p>
